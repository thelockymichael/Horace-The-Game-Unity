# Run-And-Gun-2D
Run and Gun is a coming mobile game made in Unity3D in my own spare time.
You take control of a foolish cowboy called Horace whose only goal is to run away from an angered bear while dodging obstacles and collecting coins and trying to get as far as possible without stumbling.

This would be the end scope for the purpose of this game. Other features that would be included are e.g. power-ups and an achievements system.

# Usage

You can either clone the directory or download the ZIP file and open it in Unity. If you want to, you can even install one of the .APK files on your Android device found in '/Run&Gun-Mobile-2D/Builds'.

# Demo
Controls: Swipe up or down depending on whether you want to jump or slide. Play or restart via the buttons accordinly.
