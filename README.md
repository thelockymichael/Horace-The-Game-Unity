# Horace The Game
Horace the Game is an unfinished mobile game made in Unity that I had been working on in my spare time. You take control of a foolish cowboy called Horace whose only goal is to run away from an angered bear while dodging obstacles and collecting coins and trying to get as far as possible without stumbling and falling flat on the ground.

This would be the end scope for the purpose of this game. Other features that would be included are e.g. power-ups and an achievements system.

# Usage

You can either clone the directory or download the ZIP file and open it in Unity. APK files are built in '/Run&Gun-Mobile-2D/Builds'.

# Demo
Controls: Swipe up or down depending on whether you want to jump or slide. Play or restart via the buttons accordinly.
